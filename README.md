# Airbnb-in-Madrid
This project was completed as part of the Data Science Nanodegree (Udacity) in November 2022 by Jos√© Imedio.

It aims at answering the following main question: 
  - What is the best spot/area to stay in Madrid (Spain)?

In order to do that, data from Airbnb in Madrid was used (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). 
After filtering the database, we plotted the data on a scatter plot, using the latitude and longitude information to make it geographically consistent. Then, we went over it and created a grid with average information of each small region. We repeated this process three times, in order to answer the following three subquestions:
  - Where do people tend to give a higher location rating?
  - Where are there more options to choose from?
  - Are the best areas too expensive?


## List of files

#### Project I - AirBnB in Madrid
Main code file, to be opened with Jupyter Notebook.
#### listings
Zip file containing data from Airbnb in Madrid (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). It needs to be unzipped and saved in the same folder as the other file.


## Libraries used

#### numpy
Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
#### pandas 
Data analysis.
#### matplotlib
Data visualization.
#### math
Additional mathematical operations.


## Comments on the process
Firstly, it is important to note that we used the location score and not the general score as the main source of information. 

During the data filtering process, we realized that accommodations with a low number of reviews tended to have very high scores. So we had to drop those rows to make sure the data we were using was as objective as possible.

Some geographical references were included on every scatter plot. That way, drawing conclusions became easier.

In order to create the grid, different sizes were tried. The one that yield the most visual results was 1 square km (approx.). This is equivalent to a rectangle of 0.009 degrees of latitude by 0.012 degrees of longitude. (https://www.johndcook.com/how_big_is_a_degree.html)

Finally, it was necessary to filter the results again before making the scatter plots. This is because the presence of outliers made the color code way less informative. And thus, the scatter plots less visual.


## Results and Conclusions

#### Where do people tend to give a higher location rating?
We can see the preferred area by Airbnb users could be modeled as a circle with a radius of about 1.5km, with its center placed slightly Northeast from Puerta del Sol.
#### Where are there more options to choose from?
Here it's very clear that the surroundings of Puerta del Sol have the highest amount of accommodations.
#### Are the best areas too expensive?
The areas mentioned in the previous two questions are not the most expensive.
